# wall-of-clocks
The project features a wall of diverse clocks, each uniquely designed using JavaScript. These clocks showcase creative visual styles, demonstrating the artistic possibilities within JavaScript programming. The interactive exhibit offers an engaging fusion of technology and design.

In a simple program, we have a standard clock, a clock block, a clock display, and a basic stopwatch.
